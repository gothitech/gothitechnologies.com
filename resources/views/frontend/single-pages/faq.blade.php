                    <p>A satisfied customer and a ready product that fully meets their needs is the ultimate objective for us when we work on every single project. In the work process, we constantly communicate with our customers, and they often ask us the same questions. On this page, we have collected the most common questions about software/app development and the answers to them. <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-accordion-collapse wc-shortcodes-accordion-layout-box" data-behavior="autoclose" data-start-state="collapse"> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">How long does software development take?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> We cannot possibly answer this question precisely because there are projects finished in 2 to 3 weeks, but there are also tasks that take several years to complete. To provide you with a precise answer, we have to evaluate the project complexity and the work scope. Knowing this information, we can provide you with the estimated time frame. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">How much will the Gothi Technologies Limited expert work cost?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> In our company, we pay our employees based on hourly rates, depending on the technology utilized and the experience level of the specialists involved in the project. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Should I be familiar with the technical details to work with you?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> There is absolutely no need for this. After all, you do not have to know medical nuances when seeking a dentist’s services. You do not have to be an expert in software development because, actually, we are. We are ready to explain to you all unclear moments and the essence of all stages while working on the project. On your part, all you need is a clear vision of what objectives you want to achieve using the desired software product. Therefore, you just have to focus on your needs, and we will help you make them a reality. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">What information do you need from me to start work?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> We specialize in solutions for domains like FinTech, Healthcare, Blockchain, Entertainment, Inspection Apps, and Bank Services. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">How do you guarantee the product quality?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> We work in a short iteration mode and regularly test the work results, taking into account all customer preferences and the target audience reaction. This approach allows us to provide our customers with high-quality products, observing the specified deadlines. Quality is our top priority. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Do you provide product support services after the app development is complete?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Yes, we are always glad to provide technical support and service the apps we have developed. We can also further develop your software product if you need to implement new features or integrate third-party services. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">I need an app for iOS and Android. Which platform is better to start with?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Which platform you should choose depends solely on the future application idea as well as its target audience. Each platform has its own monetization model. Apple users spend more money on paid apps and in-app purchases. If the goal is a direct monetization, then iOS should be chosen. There are more Android users; however, they are less likely pay for app installation and prefer free applications. The more downloads, the more expensive the advertising is in the application. Android should be chosen if the goal is managing user attention. We highly recommend starting with only one platform or build cross-platform application. This will speed up launching the project, and help to assess its weaknesses and make any necessary changes. This will save you money and time. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Will you be able to increase the number of people in your team if necessary?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> If you wish to partly reduce the project work intensity or, on the contrary, to increase it at times, we are always ready to adapt to your needs. When necessary, we will easily involve more team members in your project to meet your expectations. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">What technologies and programming languages do you utilize in your work?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Our experts possess a wide range of skills, enabling us to offer our customers the best solutions to achieve their goals. The basic Gothi Technologies Limited profile is .NET development and blockchain; we also work with C#, ASP.NET Core/MVC, Xamarin, Angular/Angular.JS, React/React.JS, Node.JS, and WPF. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">What is the minimum budget and the project size you are willing to work with?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> The minimum budget you can start with is $3,000. Over the years, our portfolio has been enriched with both large enterprise solutions and apps designed to implement single-person ideas. The project size is not that important to us, but its benefits and ability to solve specific problems are. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Will you sign an NDA?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Yes, sure. If you want to sign an NDA, we are always ready to do so. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">What methodologies do you use in your work?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> The main methodology we use in our work is Agile, although the choice may depend on a particular project. An iterative approach to the work on the project provides us with the opportunity to regularly improve the product quality, and also constant customer feedback. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">What is your customer geography?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> We provide our services to customers from all over the world; our key markets are the USA, Australia, New Zealand, and countries in Central and Western Europe. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">How long do I have to wait before the work on my project starts?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Typically, it takes about two weeks to start cooperating on the project. However, it depends on the project features and the number of people involved in it. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Which payment model do you practice?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Gothi Technologies Limited offers its customers several pricing models, which allows any company to choose the best option: Fixed Price, Time &amp; Materials, or Dedicated Team Model. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Can you make changes to a product which other developers have already started?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Yes, we can. Our software engineers are well versed in various technologies and will practically always be able to continue the product started by some other team. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">Where are your company’s office and employees located?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Our headquarters and 100% of our employees are located in Lviv, Ukraine (which is one of the most dynamic IT centers in Eastern Europe). </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">How does the project work process take place?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> Each project is unique and requires a customized approach, but most of the development stages are relevant to all of them. However, the very process of their implementation may differ somewhat. We recommend you read more about our work processes on our website. </div></div> <div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-trigger "><a href="#">We have got an idea, but we would like to verify it. What shall we do in this case?</a></div><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content-wrapper"><div class="wc-shortcodes-accordion-content wc-shortcodes-content"> It does not always make sense to invest all your time and budget resources for the immediate launch of a large project. The trouble is that the project may fail to meet the actual market needs. Therefore, if you have an idea, but you are not entirely sure of it, we recommend you test the concept with an MVP development. </div></div> </div> If you have any questions you can&#8217;t find the answers to on this page, or you are eager to discuss the project details before starting out cooperation, just contact us and we will gladly answer all your questions.</p>
