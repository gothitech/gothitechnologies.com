						<p style="text-align: center;">Independently or more often in combination with other technologies, the PHP programming language is suitable for developing IT projects of any type: from simple websites to CRM solutions and large marketplaces. By using it, you can significantly speed up the development process, reduce its cost, and get all the necessary functionality to create a website from scratch.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">BENEFITS YOU GET FROM USING PHP TO SOLVE BUSINESS PROBLEMS</h3>
Companies choose PHP web development for several reasons important to businesses. Some arguments in favor of it are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Affordable development cost.</strong> PHP is an open-source technology and distributed under the GPL license. It allows you to quickly develop prototypes and finished websites. A large community of developers work using PHP and sharing their experiences with each other.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cross-platform software and compatibility.</strong> This programming language is compatible with and supports all widespread servers used to run web apps (Apache, IIS, iPlanet, etc.) and more than 20 databases. PHP code works equally well with different platforms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Possibility to develop websites of any type.</strong> Using PHP, you can develop websites of almost any type, including complex solutions like large online stores and CRM systems.</li>
 	<li><strong>Convenience in expanding functionality.</strong> Website functionality can be easily expanded due to abundant extensions and libraries available on the Internet for free. Besides, PHP developers will have no difficulty to add custom extensions created by them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR PHP DEVELOPMENT SERVICES INCLUDE</strong></h3>
