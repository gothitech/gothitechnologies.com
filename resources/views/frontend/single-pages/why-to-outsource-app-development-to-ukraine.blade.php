        ><p>A lot of companies all over the world require mobile apps and web services development for their business needs. But few have proper staff specialists, which is not surprising, because such work is a costly thing to be implemented.</p>
<p>To optimize costs without losing quality some companies use software development outsourcing. It works like that &#8211; the project is delegated to the development team which is located in another country.</p>
<p>An important advantage of outsourcing is the ability to save resources and optimize business processes. And most importantly, the customer gets the opportunity to work with real experts in the required field.</p>
<h3>Why Ukraine?</h3>
<p>Being a country with a rather low cost of living, Ukraine offers IT specialists’ services at relatively low prices. At the same time, they boast a high level of performance, so that large world-class companies use this country as the main destination for software development outsourcing.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to Outsourcing Journal and GSA (Global Sourcing Association, Great Britain), Ukraine was named the best place for software outsourcing in Eastern Europe in 2017.<br />

width="750" height="563" 
 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><br />
IBM, Trip Advisor, Cisco and other Fortune 500 list companies outsource their development to Ukraine, because our developers have proven themselves as reliable partners in software development for European and American customers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Benefits of Software Outsourcing to Ukraine</h3>
<p>By virtue of the highly qualified developers’ abundance and developed ecosystem, Ukraine is rapidly becoming the No. 1 choice for companies in various industries that need software outsourcing, R&amp;D and other IT services.</p>
<p>We have compiled a list of 9 reasons that best explain why IT outsourcing to Ukraine will be the right choice for your business.</p>
<h3>A huge number of talented specialists</h3>
<p>As of early 2018, there are 110,000 people employed in IT in Ukraine. Following that it takes the fourth place in the world after the USA, India and Russia. There are more than 1000 IT companies, and 19% of all developers have 7 years of work experience and more.<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1241 aligncenter" src="{{asset('frontend/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uo2.jpg')}}" alt="IT Talents in Ukraine" width="530" height="575"
  sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /><br />
Among all the European countries Ukraine ranks first in the ratio of the number of specialists engaged in software development to the total volume of human resources. Thanks to the solid grounding of developers, the country retains leadership in Eastern Europe in terms of the orders volume in the region.</p>
<h3>Excellent quality-price ratio</h3>
<p>Web and mobile development outsourcing to Ukraine allows you to achieve more with investing less, which can be considered as an effective way to optimize costs.</p>
<p>Compared to India and the Philippines, Ukrainians offer a much higher quality of work. At the same time, the cost will be much lower compared to hiring the programmers from Western Europe or the United States.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1242" src="{{asset('frontend/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uo3.jpg')}}" alt="Developer Rates" width="750" height="472" 
 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><br />
The average hourly rate is in the range of $ 25-40 (approximately 60% lower than in the US), which is also a competitive rate compared to such neighboring countries as Poland or the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3>Time zone and geography</h3>
<p>Country’s favorable geographical location and time zone (GMT +2) make it easier to work with a remote team in Ukraine. If you are in Europe, the time difference will be minimal. Even a 7 hours difference with the customers from the US is still more convenient compared to working with the companies in India (GMT +5: 30) for instance.<br />
<a href="{{asset('frontend/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uo4.jpg')}}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1243" src="{{asset('frontend/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uo4.jpg')}}" 
    alt="Ukraine Time-zone" width="1071" height="382" 
     sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px" /></a><br />
Foreigners can easily stay in the country without a visa for up to 90 days. If you are in Western Europe, then it will take you only 1 to 3 hours to get to Ukraine by plane.<br />
Being located at the crossroads of trade routes, Ukraine is a perfect place for opening a local office and effective control of business activity in the region.</p>
<h3>Developed IT industry</h3>
<p>At the moment, there are more than 1000 IT companies operating in Ukraine, as well as there are hundreds of start-ups. Many of them, for example, SoftServe, DepositPhotos, Readdle, PetCube, Grammarly &#8211; have reached a high point of development and are known all over the world.<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1244 aligncenter" src="{{asset('frontend/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uo5.jpg')}}" alt="IT companies in Ukraine" width="714" height="524" 

sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /><br />
Ukraine ranks 5th in the list of the largest IT services exporters, and from year to year this indicator demonstrates impressive growth rates. This is one of few country&#8217;s economy sectors which is steadily developing and gaining momentum.</p>
<h3>Big R&amp;D hub</h3>
<p>Now, there are operating research centers of Cisco, Oracle, Siemens, IBM and other world industry giants. Moreover, more and more international companies continue to open their headquarters in this country. There are several cities that are technological centers and that allows diversifying risks.</p>
<p>Also, a rich technological environment contributes to the rapid growth of products that have emerged from local developers. We listed several of them in the previous paragraph, but there are also Jooble, TemplateMonster, Mobalytics, <a href="https://preply.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Preply</a>, InvisibleCRM and other famous players that were created by developers from Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Decent level of English</h3>
<p>Not everyone in the Ukrainian IT has good English, but there are many specialists who do. Although pronunciation can be specific, it is still more understandable than of many other non-native speakers.</p>
<p>80% of Ukrainian developers have a medium and high level of English:<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1245 aligncenter" src="{{asset('frontend/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uo6.jpg')}}" alt="English Expertise in Ulrainian IT Sector"
 width="597" height="363"  
 sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p>Ukraine is a European country where English is the most common and popular language in terms of education. In addition, the companies themselves encourage their employees studying English by organizing free courses in their offices.</p>
<h3>Cultural compatibility</h3>
<p>Ukrainians communicate in the traditional European style, and the workflow in outsourcing companies in many respects resembles the one in Western Europe and the United States. You will have no communication barriers.</p>
<p>Cultural similarities make it possible to organize the workflow in the most comfortable way, forming a result-oriented environment, rather than a process. You must admit that working with people who have a European mentality is easier than with those whose culture is far different.</p>
<p>It is always easier to cooperate with people who are in tune with you.</p>
<h3>Good educational background</h3>
<p>From Ukrainian colleges and universities there annually graduate more than 30,000 specialists in physics, mathematics, programming and other technical sciences. Thanks to innovations, opportunities for growth and development, many young people consider IT as the best choice for a future career.<br />

sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><br />
Thanks to the balanced representation educational model to the exact sciences and the humanities, engineers from Ukraine are widely known for their intelligence and non-traditional problem solving approach.</p>
<p>The country has been remaining one of the most powerful technology centers for many decades, and approximately 80% of all Ukrainian specialists have a bachelor&#8217;s degree.</p>
